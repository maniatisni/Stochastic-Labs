# Stochastic Processes and Optimization in Machine Learning 
## Nikolaos Maniatis

This is the repository of my lab solutions for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes &amp; Optimization in Machine Learning. This course is included in the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSML) program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).  
  
The following exercises are provided: 
1) Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression  
2) Logistic Regression, K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
3) Markov Chains and Simulation (heavily based on the Stochastic Processes course of the 6th semester in ECE NTUA)  
4) The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm  
5) Simulated Annealing and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)  
6) Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning  
7) Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Application in the BGP protocol)  
8) Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS attack mitigation: the DNS Water Torture Attack use case)  
9) Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
10) Decision Trees and Random Forests  
  
Note: Some notebooks were corrupt and I dind't bother to fix them, but I included .html files you can download and open on a browser.
